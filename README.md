# Bookstore CMS

> Bookstore CMS is an app that allows users to display a list of books, add new books, and remove a selected book. The app allows users to easily manage their book collection and keep track of books they have read. In addition, the app provides an easy way to add new books and remove books from the list. All data is saved to an external API.
